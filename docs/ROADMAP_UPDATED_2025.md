### 📊 PHASE 1 COMPLETE DEFINITION OF DONE

**User Flow - End to End**:
1. ✅ User visits `/markets/create`
2. ✅ Creates market: "Will COFFEE reach $3.00 by Dec 31, 2025?"
3. ✅ Protocol automatically adds $100 liquidity (50 YES / 50 NO)
4. ✅ User goes to `/markets`, sees the new market
5. ✅ User clicks "Trade", stakes $10 USDC on YES
6. ✅ User's position shows in `/markets/my-positions`
7. ✅ Market expires on Dec 31
8. ✅ Oracle updates COFFEE price → $3.10 (YES wins!)
9. ✅ Market auto-resolves to YES outcome
10. ✅ User clicks "Claim Winnings" → Receives $15 USDC (50% ROI)

**Success Metrics**:
- [ ] 5+ test markets created
- [ ] 20+ test stakes placed
- [ ] 10+ successful payouts claimed
- [ ] <1 second settlement time (Solana)
- [ ] <$0.01 transaction fees (Solana)
