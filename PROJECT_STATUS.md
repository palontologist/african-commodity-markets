## 🔴 What's Blocking You (15%)

### Critical Blocker #1: Insufficient MATIC ⚠️
**Impact**: Cannot deploy contracts  
**Required**: 0.15 MATIC (~$0.13)  
**Current**: 0.000955 MATIC (~$0.0008)  
**Solution**: Get testnet MATIC from faucet (5 minutes)  
**Link**: https://faucet.polygon.technology/

### Minor Issue #2: Low Test USDC 💵
**Impact**: Limited testing capability  
**Required**: 100 USDC for robust testing  
**Current**: 0 USDC  
**Solution**: Get test USDC after deployment  
**Link**: https://faucet.circle.com/

## 🚀 Next Steps (In Order)

### Immediate (Today - 2 hours)

1. **Get MATIC** (5 minutes)
   ```bash
   # Visit: https://faucet.polygon.technology/
   # Enter wallet: 0x95432C47b65A381B2bC43779Fd97e5017f39aB82
   # Request testnet MATIC
   ```

2. **Deploy Contracts** (10 minutes)
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-bridge.js --network polygon-amoy

   ```

4. **Test Staking** (30 minutes)
   - Get test USDC
   - Approve USDC spending
   - Place test stake
   - Verify transaction

5. **Verify on PolygonScan** (10 minutes)
   ```bash
