### 2. Marketplace Conversion (`/app/market` â†’ `/app/marketplace`)

#### Directory Structure:
```
/app/marketplace/
  â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx (new tokenization focus)
  â””â”€â”€ [commodity]/
      â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx (preserved trading interface)
      â””â”€â”€ not-found.tsx
```

#### New Marketplace Focus:
**Three Main Features:**
1. **Tokenized Commodities**: ERC-1155 tokens backed by warehouse receipts
2. **Warehouse Receipts**: NFT-based digital receipts for physical storage
3. **Fractional Ownership**: Minimum $10 investment for democratized access

**How It Works Section:**
1. **Verify**: Physical commodity inspected and graded
2. **Tokenize**: Stored in secure warehouse and minted on blockchain
3. **Trade**: Buy/sell tokens representing real ownership
4. **Redeem**: Burn tokens for physical delivery or cash

**Stats Display:**
- Total Value Locked: $2.4M
- Listed Assets: 847
- 24h Volume: $387K
- Active Traders: 1,243

**Coming Soon Features:**

### 3. Navigation Updates

- Grades page: `/marketplace/{commodity}` and `/marketplace/tea`
- All navigation now uses `/marketplace` routes

### 4. Data Structure

#### COMMODITY_DATA Array:
```typescript
{
  id: string
  name: string
  symbol: CommoditySymbol
  icon: LucideIcon
  description: string
  grade: string
  color: string
  countries: {
    AFRICA: string[]
    LATAM: string[]
  }
}
```

#### Region State Management:
```typescript
const [selectedRegion, setSelectedRegion] = useState<Region>('AFRICA')
const [selectedCommodity, setSelectedCommodity] = useState<string>('all')
const [livePrices, setLivePrices] = useState<Record<string, any>>({})
```

#### Live Price Integration:
- useEffect re-fetches prices when region changes
- Prices fetched for all 6 commodities via `getLivePrice(symbol, region)`
- Displays real-time price with trend indicators

- Stats prominently displayed

**Tokenization Focus:**
- Separate trading (individual commodity pages) from tokenization (marketplace)
- Emphasize real-world asset backing
- Clear explanation of verification process
- Highlight coming features to build anticipation

**User-Centric:**
- One-click region switching
- Country visibility for each commodity
- Intuitive filtering and navigation
- Clear value proposition for tokenization
