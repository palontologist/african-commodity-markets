# Solana Deployment Status

## Issues Encountered

After migrating from deprecated Solana CLI to Agave 2.3.13, we've encountered several persistent issues with the build toolchain:

### Problem 1: Cargo.lock Version Incompatibility (RESOLVED)
- Modern Cargo (1.90) generates v4 lockfiles
- Old Solana BPF compiler only supported v3
- **Solution**: Migrated to Agave 2.3.13

### Problem 2: Platform Tools / Rust Toolchain Issues (ONGOING)
- `cargo-build-sbf` requires a custom "solana" rust toolchain
- When installed, it fails with "not a directory" errors for rust/lib
- When uninstalled, it fails because it can't find the toolchain
- Platform tools download but don't include required rust standard library

### Problem 3: Anchor Version Mismatch
- Programs use anchor-lang 0.30.1
- Anchor CLI is 0.32.0  
- AVM (Anchor Version Manager) fails to install 0.30.1
- Updated to 0.32.0 but build toolchain still broken

## Recommended Path Forward

Given the persistent toolchain issues with Agave + Anchor, we have a few options:

### Option 1: Use Native Solana Programs (RECOMMENDED)
- Skip Anchor framework entirely
- Write raw Solana programs with borsh serialization
- Use `solana program deploy` directly
- **Pros**: More reliable, fewer dependencies, direct control
- **Cons**: More boilerplate code, manual account validation

### Option 2: Use Solana Playground (Online)
- Deploy programs via https://beta.solpg.io/
- Online IDE with pre-configured toolchain
- Export keypairs and program IDs
- **Pros**: Works immediately, no local setup
- **Cons**: Less integrated with our workflow

### Option 3: Continue Debugging Agave
- Try different Agave versions
- Manually build platform-tools from source
- Debug rustup toolchain configuration
- **Pros**: Eventually get Anchor working
- **Cons**: Time-consuming, uncertain outcome

### Option 4: Use Docker Container
- Use official Solana/Anchor Docker images
- Pre-configured build environment
- **Pros**: Isolated, reproducible
- **Cons**: Docker overhead, less convenient

## Current State

- ✅ Agave 2.3.13 installed
- ✅ Wallet funded with 2 SOL
- ✅ Devnet configured
- ✅ Programs written (oracle + prediction-market)
- ❌ Build toolchain broken
- ❌ Programs not deployed

## Next Steps

**Immediate**: Choose one of the options above and proceed.

**Recommendation**: Option 1 (Native Solana Programs) for fastest path to deployment.
