# USDC Staking Model for Commodity Exposure 🪙

## Overview

The marketplace has been converted from an NFT/tokenization model to a **direct USDC staking model**. This aligns perfectly with your existing prediction market infrastructure where users stake USDC on outcomes.

## Model Comparison

### ❌ OLD MODEL (NFT Tokenization)
- ERC-1155 tokens representing physical commodities
- Warehouse receipt NFTs for storage verification
- Fractional token ownership
- Complex redemption process (burn tokens → claim physical goods)
- Multiple token standards to manage
- Physical delivery logistics required

### ✅ NEW MODEL (USDC Staking)
- Direct USDC deposits into commodity pools
- Stake value tracks real commodity prices
- No NFTs or complex tokens needed
- Simple deposit/withdraw USDC flow
- Single currency: USDC only
- Pure financial exposure (no physical logistics)

## How It Works

### 1. **Stake USDC** 💰
- User deposits USDC into a commodity pool (Coffee, Cocoa, Tea, Cotton, Avocado, Macadamia)
- Minimum stake: **$10 USDC**
- Choose lock period: 30, 90, or 180 days
- Longer lock periods = higher APY

### 2. **Track Value** 📊
- Staked value follows **real commodity prices** from:
  - Alpha Vantage API
  - World Bank Commodity Price Data
- Price updates every 5 minutes (same as your prediction oracle)
- Example: Stake $100 in Coffee pool → Price goes up 10% → Your stake worth $110

### 3. **Earn Yields** 📈
- **Two sources of returns:**
  1. **Price Appreciation**: Your USDC value increases with commodity price
  2. **Pool Rewards**: Additional 8-15% APY from pool emissions

- **APY Breakdown by Lock Period:**
  - 30 days: Base APY (8-10%)
  - 90 days: Base APY + 2% bonus (10-12%)
  - 180 days: Base APY + 5% bonus (13-15%)

### 4. **Unstake USDC** 💸
- Withdraw anytime: USDC principal + gains
- **Early withdrawal fee**: 2% if unstaking before lock period ends
- Fee goes back to pool (rewards other stakers)
- After lock period: Zero fees, instant withdrawal

## Smart Contract Structure

### Commodity Pool Contract
```solidity
// Pseudocode structure
contract CommodityStakingPool {
    mapping(address => Stake) public stakes;
    
    struct Stake {
        uint256 amount;        // USDC staked
        uint256 lockUntil;     // Lock period end timestamp
        string commodity;      // Coffee, Cocoa, etc.
        uint256 entryPrice;    // Commodity price at stake time
        uint256 multiplier;    // 1.0x, 1.2x, 1.5x based on lock period
    }
    
    function stake(uint256 amount, uint256 lockDays, string commodity) external {
        // Transfer USDC from user
        // Record entry price from oracle
        // Set multiplier based on lockDays
        // Update total staked
    }
    
    function calculateValue(address staker) public view returns (uint256) {
        Stake memory s = stakes[staker];
        uint256 currentPrice = oracle.getPrice(s.commodity);
        
        // Value = staked amount * (currentPrice / entryPrice) * multiplier
        uint256 priceGain = (s.amount * currentPrice) / s.entryPrice;
        uint256 bonusYield = calculateTimeBasedBonus(s);
        
        return priceGain + bonusYield;
    }
    
    function unstake() external {
        Stake memory s = stakes[msg.sender];
        uint256 value = calculateValue(msg.sender);
        
        // Apply early withdrawal fee if before lock period
        if (block.timestamp < s.lockUntil) {
            value = value * 98 / 100; // 2% fee
        }
        
        // Transfer USDC to user
        usdc.transfer(msg.sender, value);
    }
}
```

## Integration with Existing Infrastructure

### ✅ Perfectly Aligned
Your platform **already uses USDC staking** for prediction markets:
- Users stake USDC on YES/NO outcomes
- Smart contracts hold USDC
- Winners claim USDC payouts

**The commodity staking model follows the exact same pattern!**

### Shared Components
- **USDC Token**: Same USDC contract used everywhere
- **Oracle Service**: Alpha Vantage & World Bank data (already implemented)
- **Wallet Integration**: Same wallet connection for staking
- **Smart Contracts**: Similar staking logic as prediction markets

### Code Reuse Opportunities

1. **Staking Logic**
   - Reuse your existing `MarketPredictionCard` staking flow
   - Same `approve()` → `stake()` → `claim()` pattern

2. **Price Oracle**
   - Already fetching commodity prices in `lib/live-prices.ts`
   - Just need to store historical entry prices

3. **UI Components**
   - Same `Button`, `Card`, `Badge` components
   - Similar "Stake Now" flows as "Predict Now"

## User Experience Flow

### Staking Journey
```
Homepage → Select Commodity (Coffee) → Click "Trade Now"
  ↓
Marketplace → View Coffee Pool → Click "Stake USDC"
  ↓
Staking Modal → Enter Amount → Select Lock Period → Approve USDC
  ↓
Confirm Transaction → Stake Recorded → Track Value in Dashboard
  ↓
Wait for Price Movement → View Gains → Click "Unstake"
  ↓
Receive USDC + Gains → Reinvest or Withdraw
```

### Example User Story

**Sarah, Coffee Trader from Kenya:**
1. Sees Coffee price is $4.80/lb on homepage
2. Believes it will rise to $5.50/lb in 3 months
3. Stakes $500 USDC in Coffee pool with 90-day lock
4. Gets 10-12% APY + price exposure

**After 90 days:**
- Coffee price: $5.30/lb (+10.4%)
- Sarah's stake value: $500 → $552 (+$52 from price)
- Plus pool rewards: ~$15 (3 months of 12% APY)
- **Total withdrawal: $567 USDC** (13.4% return)

## Risk Disclosures

### Smart Contract Risk

- Always stake only what you can afford to lose
- Consider starting with minimum $10 to test

### Price Volatility Risk
- Commodity prices can go down as well as up
- Your USDC value decreases if commodity price drops
- Diversify across multiple pools to reduce risk

### Early Withdrawal Penalty
- 2% fee if unstaking before lock period
- Plan your lock period carefully
- Consider shorter locks if you need flexibility
