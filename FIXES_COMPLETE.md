## What Was Fixed

### 1. Build Error ❌ → ✅

```
Module not found: Can't resolve '@solana/wallet-adapter-react'
```

1. Connect wallet
2. Click market card
3. Try staking (needs USDC)

### Seeding Benefits
- **10 diverse markets** instead of 1
- **Multiple commodities** (COFFEE, COCOA, etc.)
- **Various expiry dates** (30-90 days)
- **Realistic data** based on Oct 2025 prices

### Troubleshooting
If something doesn't work:
1. Clear browser cache (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Check wallet connected to **Polygon Amoy**
3. Verify `.env.local` has correct addresses
4. Look at browser console for errors
